/**

 *
 * **The adapter is the authority, not the map above.** `classification` is a
 * required field on `VenueAdapter`, so the compiler makes a venue author state
 * it; `VENUE_CLASSIFICATIONS` is hand-maintained prose that carries the
 * reasoning. If the two ever disagree, the declaration a venue cannot be
 * written without is the one to believe — and
 * `venueAdapters.test.ts` fails the build when they do, so the disagreement is
 * caught rather than resolved silently at runtime.
 *
 * Unknown venues default to 'primary'. `price_points.source` carries values
 * with no adapter behind them (CEX feeds, for instance), and those are real
 * independent markets. The risk this leaves is a *new aggregator* nobody
 * registered being counted toward net volume; the drift test is what closes it,
 * because an aggregator must have an adapter to be ingested at all.
