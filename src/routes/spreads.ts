 * Register the bid/ask spread endpoint.
 *
 * `GET /spreads/:asset?window=5m|15m|1h|24h&network=testnet|mainnet`
 *
 * Reports, for every (venue, pair) that quoted `asset` inside the window, the
 * low, the high and the gap between them in basis points — then the tightest of
 * them, which is the practical answer to "where should I trade this".
 *
 * ## What the numbers actually mean
 *
 * Lens stores one `price` per observation, not a quoted bid and ask. So a
 * venue's spread here is the dispersion of its own recent prints — the range it
 * traded through over the window — rather than a book's top-of-book gap. That
 * is a real liquidity signal (a thin venue prints a wide range, a deep one
 * prints a tight one) but it is **not** the number that venue's own order book
 * would report, and it should not be presented as one.
 *
 * Basis points are taken against the **mid**, not against the ask:
 *
 *     spreadBps = (ask - bid) / ((ask + bid) / 2) * 10_000
 *
 * Dividing by the ask makes the figure depend on which side you divided by, so
 * two venues quoting the same absolute range score differently. The mid is
 * symmetric.
 *
 * ## Why the grouping is (venue, pair) and not venue
 *
 * XLM/USDC and XLM/EURC on the same venue are different books at different
 * price scales. Collapsing them into one "venue spread" would take the min and
 * max across two unrelated scales and report the gap between them — a number
 * that is not merely imprecise but meaningless.
