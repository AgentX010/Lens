# Changelog

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 81d8e59: Add seller-side Bazaar discovery helpers (`src/bazaar/declare.ts`): `param.*`
  constructors that make per-parameter descriptions a required positional
  argument, `declareHttpResource` / `declareMcpTool` builders that assemble the
  `extensions.bazaar` declaration and its JSON Schema, and
  `validateDeclaration` / `assertDeclaration` which run the catalog's own
  `validateListing` plus seller-side metadata-quality rules so malformed listings
  fail at development time rather than in production. Lens's own gated routes
  (`/price`, `/candles`, `/pools`, `/price/twap`, and the MCP price tool) are
  declared with them in `src/bazaar/lensListings.ts`.
- 059ca5a: Add a `priceUpdated(pair: String!, network: String)` GraphQL subscription that streams live prices over the existing `/graphql` endpoint (graphql-transport-ws protocol). Every ingester (SDEX, Horizon AMM, Soroswap) publishes `{ pair, price, ts, network }` on each new price; subscribers receive only the pair they request. `network` is optional and narrows the stream to one chain — omitting it delivers every enabled network, which is only safe if the subscriber reads the `network` field on each message, since a dual-network deployment otherwise interleaves two chains' prices for the same pair.

### Patch Changes

- e091749: Partition the aggregation layer by network. Every function in
  `src/aggregator/vwap.ts` now takes a required `network` and filters
  `price_points`/`pool_snapshots` on it, and `getAMMPrice` filters both the
  `pool_snapshots` scan and the `pool_id` subquery. Previously an unfiltered read
  returned a volume-weighted blend of both chains' rows for a pair key that
  exists on both, so `/price/:a/:b` answered with a number nobody traded at and
  stamped it `"network":"mainnet"`.

  `/price/:assetA/:assetB` passes `req.network` through to the aggregator, so the
  `network` field in the response is the one the numbers came from. The aggregate
  refresh worker now runs once per enabled network — its own queue name, its own
  pair list, and `price_aggregates` upserts stamped with its network — where it
  previously pinned all three to `STELLAR_NETWORK`, leaving the second network's
  `/price/*/history` and `/screener` permanently empty. The Redis price key it
  writes is network-prefixed, matching what the REST route reads.

- 7ba1f47: Preserve TWAP timestamp alignment when outlier prices are rejected.
- d546b0b: `GET /prices/history` now honours `?network=` / `x-network` instead of always
  querying the deployment's default network, and echoes the resolved `network`
  in the response. `queryHistory()` takes `network` as a parameter.
- 5ef1591: Add a `network` label to the four ingest metrics — `trades_ingested_total`,
  `amm_snapshots_total`, `price_snapshots_total` and `last_trade_timestamp` — so a
  dual-network deployment (`ENABLED_NETWORKS=testnet,mainnet`) reports each
  network separately instead of folding them together.

  `last_trade_timestamp` is the one that mattered: it is a gauge, so the testnet
  ingester's `set()` was overwriting mainnet's value for the same pair every poll
  interval, making Lens's only staleness signal silently unusable — it still
  looked like a plausible timestamp. The counters were less broken but equally
  unqueryable per network, since the two loops summed into one series.

  Cardinality is unchanged in character: `pairs x networks` (plus `pools` on
  `amm_snapshots_total`), all bounded by `WATCHED_PAIRS` and `ENABLED_NETWORKS`.
  No `issuer` or `pool` label was added. Existing queries that did not filter by
  `network` keep working and now return one series per network instead of a
  merged one, so a recording rule that aggregated across networks before will see
  one additional series per pair.

  Documented in [`docs/ingest-metrics.md`](docs/ingest-metrics.md).

- 3c43cfe: Fix network-blind webhooks and price tracking across SDEX, Horizon AMM, Soroswap, and Aquarius ingesters:
  - Key module-level `lastPrice` maps by `(network, pairKey)` so price ticks on one chain do not supply the previous price for another chain.
  - Dispatch webhook price updates for the network the event originated from rather than falling back to the process active network.
  - Allow specifying network on webhook subscription (`POST /webhooks`) with validation.
- 2ea353b: Document the full public route surface in `openapi.yaml` (params, the shared
  `?network=` query, and response schemas) and add `tests/openapi.test.ts`, which
  boots the app, enumerates every registered route and fails when a non-internal
  route is missing from the spec. Operator-only and non-HTTP routes are excluded
  through an explicit, commented allow-list in `src/openapi/coverage.ts`. The
  generator is now importable and deterministic, and a test asserts the committed
  `openapi.json` matches it.
- 7ecd06d: `GET /pairs` and `GET /pools` no longer scan the whole history of every network
  on each request. Both now filter by network (`req.network`, default the active
  network) and read one index entry per pair / pool, so cost no longer grows with
  table size. Response shape is unchanged. A pair or pool that has gone quiet is
  still listed with its real last-update timestamp (it is never dropped).
- 2c9d8a4: Snapshot retention now prunes `price_snapshots` for every network in
  `ENABLED_NETWORKS`, not just the active one, so the second network of a
  dual-network process no longer grows unbounded. The startup prune, the BullMQ
  worker and the in-process fallback timer all use the new `pruneAllNetworks()`,
  and the pruned row count is logged per network. `pruneOldSnapshots()` gains an
  optional `network` argument (defaulting to the active network).
- 9abd1f0: `/screener` no longer reports `market_cap`. It was a copy of `liquidity` under another name, so sorting or filtering by market cap silently sorted or filtered liquidity. Lens has no circulating-supply data to compute a real one, so the field is removed from the response and the sort allowlist, and `?market_cap=` and `?sortBy=market_cap` now return a 400 instead of being ignored. The three CTEs behind `/screener` are also now scoped to one network (`?network=` / `x-network`, defaulting to the active network) instead of pooling testnet and mainnet rows.
- d53ac14: Fix `slippagePct` on `/price/:a/:b/route`, which was always exactly 0 because
  the execution price was compared with itself. It is now the shortfall of the
  execution price against the AMM reserve-ratio spot price, so it grows with
  order size against a fixed pool. Route selection and `estimatedOutput` are
  unchanged. Slippage is only reported for an AMM route; SDEX and SPLIT routes
  (and pairs with no AMM pool) have no size-independent spot reference, so the
  value stays 0 rather than reporting a cross-venue spread as slippage.
- 61c1854: Fix `GET /status`: scope `indexer_state` to the requested network (`?network=`
  / `x-network`, defaulting to `STELLAR_NETWORK`) instead of returning whichever
  chain wrote most recently, and report the answering network and its watched
  pairs in the response.

  The SDEX and AMM ingesters now derive each trade's ledger from the TOID prefix
  of its Horizon id — Horizon sends no `ledger` field on a trade — so price points
  carry a real ledger again and `lastIndexedLedger` is no longer permanently null.
  A malformed id falls back to the last stored ledger, and the batch is deferred
  if no ledger can be established. A new `ingestLagSeconds` field surfaces a
  stalled ingester without Prometheus.

- 29e834a: Config now validates every Soroban contract id it hands out (Soroswap factory,
  Reflector oracle) with `StrKey.isValidContract`. A malformed id no longer boots
  the feature "enabled" and fails on every RPC call: it logs a warning naming the
  env var and disables that feature on that network. Two built-in defaults were
  55 characters and therefore invalid; the testnet Soroswap factory default is
  replaced with the address from Soroswap's published testnet deployment, and the
  mainnet Reflector default is removed, so the oracle stays off until
  `REFLECTOR_CONTRACT_ID_MAINNET` is set. `.env.example` and the deploy docs are
  updated.
- 789b054: `GET /volumes/:asset` now filters `price_points` by network instead of summing
  testnet and mainnet volume together. It accepts `?network=testnet|mainnet`
  (default: the active network), returns 400 for any other value, and echoes the
  resolved `network` in the response body.
- dca5ff3: Add `docs/x402-conformance.md`: a conformance baseline for the public `x402.org`
  facilitator on `stellar:testnet`, established by settling a real payment through
  it with an unmodified `@stellar/stellar-sdk` client and feeding it deliberately
  bad input. Records `/supported` verbatim, a settled transaction hash, a
  reason-per-rejection table, and five divergences between the reference
  implementation's advertised and actual behaviour. This is the baseline the Lens
  facilitator (#124, #125, #126) is measured against.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe48e4: Add `/prices/history` endpoint backed by 1-minute price snapshots. A new `price_snapshots` table is appended to every minute by a snapshot ingester, queryable over a `[from, to]` window with optional `5m`/`1h` aggregation. A retention job prunes snapshots older than 30 days.

### Patch Changes

- 5a68745: Adopt changesets for versioning and release notes. Adds `@changesets/cli`, a release GitHub Actions workflow that opens a "Version Packages" PR for pending changesets and tags releases on merge, and contributor docs for the workflow.

All notable changes to Lens are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
