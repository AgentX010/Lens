# What Lens Knows: A Question-Led API Index

Lens is a unified price and market analytics engine for the Stellar network. It aggregates order-book depth from the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX), automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pools, and external decentralized oracles.

Instead of an arbitrary alphabetized URL list, this page organizes what Lens knows around **real questions developers ask**, sequenced in the order a newcomer explores the protocol.

---

## Why This Order? (Newcomer Rationale)

A developer arriving at Lens does not browse by HTTP verb or path parameter. Their exploration follows a natural progression:

1. **Core Pricing & Trade Execution (Steps 1–6)**:
   The universal entry question: *"What is an asset trading at right now?"* (`/price/:assetA/:assetB`). Once price is known, the immediate follow-up is execution: *"Where do I get the best return for my trade size?"* (`/price/:assetA/:assetB/route`), *"What does combined order-book depth look like?"* (`/book/:assetA/:assetB`), *"How much slippage will I incur?"* (`/price/:assetA/:assetB/depth`), and how that slippage grows with size (`/impact/:assetA/:assetB`). Pricing in a local currency rather than dollars lives here too (`/price/:asset/fiat`).

2. **Market Overview & Liquidity Pools (Steps 7–15)**:
   Having evaluated immediate execution, the developer surveys market breadth: *"Which trading pairs are tracked?"* (`/pairs`), *"How do I track a new asset?"* (`POST /pairs`), *"Which AMM pools exist and what are their reserves?"* (`/pools`), and *"Where is cross-venue volume concentrated?"* (`/volumes/:asset`, `/venues`). Totals and one-request overviews answer the same question at the level of the whole network (`/tvl`, `/snapshot`), and lending venues answer what capital earns or costs (`/rates`, `/rates/:asset`).

3. **Comparative Analytics & Market Quality (Steps 16–30)**:
   Here Lens answers analytical questions that raw Horizon endpoints cannot: *"Which venue has the tightest bid-ask spread?"* (`/spreads/:asset`), *"Which pairs are top gainers or most liquid today?"* (`/screener`, `/movers`), *"Is a pegged stablecoin holding its target price?"* (`/benchmark/:asset`, `/pegs`), and *"How do Lens prices compare to external oracles?"* (`/compare/:asset`, plus its window statistics and history). Then the questions about trust in the data itself: whether venues disagree and which is the outlier (`/dispersion`), whether on-chain trades rich or cheap to the centralised market (`/premium/:assetA/:assetB`), how much of the market is actually observed (`/coverage`), and whether a basket is genuinely diversified (`/basket`, `/correlation`).

4. **Historical Trends & Robust Averages (Steps 31–35)**:
   Developers building charting UIs, backtesting trading models, or writing smart contracts need temporal data: *"Can I get OHLCV candlesticks?"* (`/candles/:assetA/:assetB`), *"What were recent rolling price buckets?"* (`/price/:assetA/:assetB/history`), *"Where can I query raw 1-minute historical snapshots or export CSV?"* (`/prices/history`), and *"What is the manipulation-resistant TWAP or VWAP for on-chain settlement?"* (`/price/twap/...`, `/price/vwap/...`).

5. **Multi-Query & Streaming (Steps 36–37)**:
   For complex web apps and trading bots: *"How do I fetch multiple prices and routes in a single request or initiate WebSocket subscriptions?"* (`GET /graphql`, `POST /graphql`).

6. **System Health & Venue Infrastructure (Steps 38–43)**:
   Operational confidence before going live: *"Is the indexer lagging and what is the latest ledger?"* (`/status`), *"Which venue adapters are active and healthy?"* (`/venues/registry`), the two probes an orchestrator needs to tell a live process from a ready one (`/live`, `/ready`), and *"What is my API key quota?"* (`/usage`, `/usage/me`).

7. **Automation, Discovery & Payments (Steps 44–50)**:
   Production integration and economic rails: *"What payable resources are discoverable via x402 Bazaar?"* (`/discovery/resources`), *"Can I find the right endpoint by describing what I want?"* (`/discovery/search`), *"How can my application receive push alerts on price thresholds?"* (`POST /webhooks`, `DELETE /webhooks/:id`), and *"How do x402 micro-payments verify and settle?"* (`/supported`, `/verify`, `/settle`).

## Provenance & Accuracy Guarantees

Every number returned by Lens carries provenance metadata:
- **Venues & Samples**: Responses indicate which venues (SDEX, AMM pools, oracles) were sampled.
- **Freshness & Ledger**: Timestamps and ledger numbers indicate the recency of each calculation.
- **Honest Answers**: If a pair has insufficient liquidity or an unmonitored window, Lens returns explicit empty states rather than deceptive zero values or 500 errors.
- **Full Contract Identifiers**: Stellar asset issuers and Soroban contract IDs are always rendered in full (e.g. `USDC:GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN`), never truncated.
