# Architecture Overview

Lens is a unified price aggregation engine for the Stellar network. It bridges the gap between Stellar's Classic Order Book (SDEX) and Liquidity Pools (AMM) by providing a single source of truth for asset pricing, VWAP calculations, and optimal trade routing.

## Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the Stellar network through our ingesters, into the database, and finally out through our API layers.

## System Components

### 1. Ingestion Layer
Lens utilizes two distinct ingestion strategies to maintain up-to-date pricing data:

*   **SDEX Ingester**: Streams trades directly from Stellar Horizon for watched asset pairs. It processes individual trade events in real-time, extracting price and volume data which is then persisted to the `price_points` table.
*   **AMM Ingester**: Polls Horizon for liquidity pool snapshots and recent AMM trades. It stores pool reserves (Asset A/B amounts) in `pool_snapshots` and individual trades in `price_points`. This allows Lens to calculate spot prices based on reserve ratios even when no trades have occurred recently.

### 2. Storage Layer
Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database optimized with declarative range partitioning and time-series indexing.
*   **`price_points`**: A unified table for all trade events across both SDEX and AMM, range-partitioned by `timestamp` into daily partitions (`price_points_yYYYYmMMdDD`). Automatic background workers pre-create future partitions ahead of need. Partition retention via metadata-only `DROP TABLE` operations is opt-in (`PRICE_POINTS_DROP_EXPIRED=true`, default: off) to safeguard raw historical records until rollups are completed (#231). Query execution plans on recent time windows leverage PostgreSQL partition pruning to scan only active partitions and skip all historical data.
*   **`pool_snapshots`**: Stores the reserve state of AMM liquidity pools, which is critical for slippage estimation and constant-product price calculations.
*   **`price_audit_records`**: An append-only audit table written once per published aggregate. Each row records the aggregate's `network`, `pairKey`, `timestamp`, the aggregation `method` and its parameters, the set of `price_points` inputs the aggregate used, and the inputs it rejected together with the reason for each rejection. This makes any published price reconstructable after the fact, so a dispute can be settled from the record rather than re-derived from raw trades.

### 3. Aggregation & Routing (`bestRoute`)
When a price is requested, the `bestRoute` engine compares the available liquidity on both SDEX and AMM:
*   **SDEX Pricing**: Fetches real-time path payment quotes from Horizon to determine the effective rate for a specific trade size.
*   **AMM Pricing**: Uses the constant-product formula (`x * y = k`) against the latest pool snapshots to estimate the output and slippage.
*   **Optimal Routing**: Compares the rates and recommends the best execution path (SDEX, AMM, or a SPLIT for large orders) to minimize slippage for the user.

Every published aggregate emits exactly one audit record. The record is keyed by `(network, pairKey, timestamp)` so it can be retrieved for a past timestamp, and it is bounded in size: the used and rejected input lists are capped at a fixed maximum number of entries per aggregate, with the overflow summarized by count rather than stored row-by-row. This keeps write amplification on the hot aggregation path constant regardless of how many `price_points` fall inside a window, and bounds total storage growth to one row per published aggregate.

### 4. API Layer & x402 Payment Gate
The system exposes both REST and GraphQL interfaces. To monetize the high-fidelity data, Lens implements the **x402 protocol**.

The **x402 Payment Gate** is a middleware that intercepts requests to premium endpoints (like `/price`, `/pools`, and `/candles`). If a valid `x-payment` header containing a signed Stellar transaction is not present, the server returns a `402 Payment Required` status along with the payment requirements (price, destination address, and network). This ensures that every high-value API call is backed by a micropayment, enabling a "pay-per-query" business model.

### 5. Audit Retrieval
Audit records are retrievable per published aggregate via `GET /audit?network=<network>&pairKey=<pairKey>&timestamp=<iso8601>`, which returns the method, its parameters, the inputs used, and the rejected inputs with their reasons. The same record is exposed as a CLI command (`lens audit reconstruct --network <network> --pair-key <pairKey> --timestamp <iso8601>`) so a past price can be reconstructed from its record without hitting the API. Both paths require an explicit `network` predicate, matching the leading column of the `price_points` and `price_audit_records` indexes.
